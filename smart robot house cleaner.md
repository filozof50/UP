### 1.2 Progress beyond the state-of-the art

The main company involved with this topic is iRobot with its production line of Roomba products.
Roombas are shown to be practical, but since their launch, only incremental improvements have been made,
and they still do essentially the same thing.
Rombas have the following features:

- Maps your home to efficiently clean an entire level
- See where Roomba cleaned
- Cleans all floor types
- Cleans until the job is done.
- Control from your smart phone.

Some alternatives to Roomba include:
- Neato Botvac Series
One of the biggest point of differences between Neato and Roomba is the navigation system.
Neato use a laser sensor called the RPS, so before the Neato even starts it’s first clean,
 it’s scans the room and sets out a map of the perimeter to avoid obstacles.

- Samsung NaviBot Corner Clean
The NaviBot maps out the home using its Visionary Mapping Plus system, the NaviBots camera takes a series of images of the ceilings in your home to build a visual map.
The Samsung NaviBot has it’s Auto Dust Emptying system – an add on dustbin that the NaviBot empties into, meaning it wont need to be as emptied nearly as much as it’s Roomba competitor.
- Infinuvo Hovo
Its biggest appeal is the price. Infinuvo, along with some other companies are just making more or less the same product as Roomba, but less polished, with competitive prices
to lure in the more economical part of the market.

We have carried out a patent search, with the following patents being relevant:
Autonomous floor-cleaning robot
US 6883201 B2

Autonomous cleaning robot
US 20130270459 A1

Autonomous surface cleaning robot for wet and dry cleaning
US 8774966 B2


We want to expand beyond the current state-of-the art by using the already proven great features of robot cleaners, and adding more functionality.
All these patents focus on cleaning the floor, but the logical follow up is to extend the possibilities so that it can also autonomously take care of other surfaces, like
cleaning the corners of the walls, cleaning the windows, and other user designated surfaces such as tables and shelves. And that is exactly what our goal with the SRHC is`

### 2.2 Individual participants

### 2.3 Consortium as a whole

While the three participants all come from the same educational background, they differ in experiences and interests in various fields.

The members of the consortium know each other well, they are passionate about their idea, and will work hard to achieve set objectives.

AB has the upper hand when it comes to the more theoretical mathematical concepts which are needed for parts of the algorithms concerned with mapping out
the house model. AB also has experience with gathering information surrounding the problem, testing, and databases. AB will be the work package leader.

ND is fond of design of algorithms which will be efficient and optimal for the problem at hand, and knowledge of geometric algorithms will be important for functionality of the SRHC.
Those algorithms will communicate with the API to the hardware of the SRHC. ND Will be the team manager.

SS will create the said API, and with his experience in mobile development will be the main developer
of the Android / iOS apps connected to the SRHC. SS will be S&T manager.

### 2.4	Resources to be committed

(Maximum length for Section 2.4 – two pages)

Describe how the totality of the necessary resources will be mobilised, including any resources that will complement the EC contribution. Show how the resources will be integrated in a coherent way, and show how the overall financial plan for the project is adequate.

In addition to the costs indicated on form A3 of the proposal, and the effort shown in section 1.3 above, please identify any other major costs (e.g. equipment). Ensure that the figures stated in Part B are consistent with these.



## Section 3. Impact

### 3.1 Expected impact listed in the work programme

Smart and healthy living at home

People automated so many aspects of our lives, but still every home needs regular vacuuming, cleaning, and dusting.
All those things take time and energy, and why should we spend those valuable resources on things we dislike doing?

With our idea, said chores aren't such waste of human productivity.
Everyone will have more time to relax, think about other things, or do more work where it counts.
