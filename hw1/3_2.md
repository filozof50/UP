## 3.2 Dissemination and/or exploitation of project results, and management of intellectual property


Dissemination will be external. We will use different kinds of dissemination channels:
  - web site of the project
	- other web sites
  - school presentations
	- commercials
	- TV
	- radio
	- facebook page of the project
	- flyers
	- billboards

Existence of the web site is very important for any project, also for ours. On the web site you can find some demo videos (how SRHC works), prices, representative offices. Users will also be able to see components of
SRHC, like smart sensors, microchips etc. We will provide links to their web sites. On their web sites will also be links to our web site and our robot.

School children are very futuristic orientated. Our idea is to exploit that. By school presentations children will be notified about our project and they will go homes and talk to their parents about amazing robot they heard about at school.

Different kinds of commercials (TV, radio) are one of the major ways to let people know what you sell. SRHC will be advertised a lot. We want to invest in commercials as we understand importance of them.

Almost everyone nowadays are on facebook. Good way of letting people know about your project is facebook. There will be SRHC facebook page where facebook users will be able to find all relevant information about our robot. There also will be pictures of it, videos too. Pictures and videos will show different kinds of cleaning our robot provides.

Billboards and will be set all over the cities and flyers will be distributed by our employees in different parts of cities.


The project will take part in different workshops, summer schools, seminars, conferences. Project has a lot of potential, and is very open for cooperation with other similar projects. There will be presentations and demos at large public events like technology fairs. There will be talk about sensors, computer vision, and also our ideas and how we managed to fulfill project goals.

We are planning to make a patent of this project. We want to protect our intellectual property. This project has some improvements in comparison to some other similar projects as described before. We will make new patent of it because we want to save our intellectual property. We will consult European Patent Convention (EPC) and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for making patent out of project.
