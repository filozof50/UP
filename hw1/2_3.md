### 2.3 Consortium as a whole

While the three participants all come from the same educational background, they differ in experiences and interests in various fields.

The members of the consortium know each other well, they are passionate about their idea, and will work hard to achieve set objectives.

AB has the upper hand when it comes to the more theoretical mathematical concepts which are needed for parts of the algorithms concerned with mapping out
the house model. AB also has experience with gathering information surrounding the problem, testing, and databases. AB will be the work package leader.

ND is fond of design of algorithms which will be efficient and optimal for the problem at hand, and knowledge of geometric algorithms will be important for functionality of the SRHC.
Those algorithms will communicate with the API to the hardware of the SRHC. ND Will be the team manager.

SS will create the said API, and with his experience in mobile development will be the main developer
of the Android / iOS applications connected to the SRHC. SS will be S&T manager.
