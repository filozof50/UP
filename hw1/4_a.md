## Section 4. Ethical Issues

The proposed project does not directly involve any ethical, legal, social issues.

Minor safety issues may arise if the SRHC makes an object fall whilst cleaning a surface that is above the floor.
To prevent those issues, safety measures will be implemented to prevent dangerous outcomes in the form of sensors and SRHC's decision making.
Decision making will always take into account what could go wrong, and in that case will skip any actions that may have an unwanted result.

Special care will be stressed on the environmental issues. We will deal with special care when
working with batteries, recycle materials, and focus on reducing the energy consumption of the SRHC.
